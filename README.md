The project is a full-stack eCommerce website built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The front-end is developed using React.js to display products, handle user login and registration, and manage the shopping cart. The back-end, developed with Express.js and Node.js, provides APIs for adding, updating, displaying products, and managing cart items. MongoDB is used for the database to store product and user data.

Front-End (React.js)
•	Product Display: The front-end is designed with React.js to provide a dynamic and responsive user interface. It allows users to browse through a catalog of products with detailed information and images.
•	User Authentication: Implemented user login and registration features. This includes form validation, secure password handling, and error handling to ensure a smooth user experience.
•	Shopping Cart Management: Users can add products to their cart, update quantities, and remove items. The cart's state is managed efficiently using React’s state management, providing a seamless shopping experience.
Back-End (Node.js and Express.js)
•	API Development: Developed RESTful APIs using Express.js to handle all back-end functionalities. This includes endpoints for adding, updating, and displaying products, as well as managing cart items.
•	Authentication: Implemented secure authentication mechanisms using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user login and registration processes, ensuring that only authenticated users can perform certain actions.
•	Order Processing: Developed APIs to handle order creation, processing, and tracking, ensuring that the entire purchasing workflow is covered.
Database (MongoDB)
•	Data Storage: Utilized MongoDB for storing product and user data. This includes product details, user information, and cart items. The non-relational nature of MongoDB allowed for flexible and scalable data models.
•	Data Relationships: Managed relationships between different collections, such as users and their orders, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
